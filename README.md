# Umee CosmWasm

This is an example for [cosmwasm](https://www.cosmwasm.com) smartcontracts to consume and
query [umee](https://github.com/umee-network/umee) native modules.

## Using your project

Once you have your custom repo, you should check out [Developing](./Developing.md) to explain
more on how to run tests and develop code. Or go through the
[online tutorial](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/) to get a better feel
of how to develop.

[Publishing](./Publishing.md) contains useful information on how to publish your contract
to the world, once you are ready to deploy it on a running blockchain. And
[Importing](./Importing.md) contains information about pulling in other contracts or crates
that have been published.

Please replace this README file with information about your specific project. You can keep
the `Developing.md` and `Publishing.md` files as useful referenced, but please set some
proper description in the README.

## Gitpod integration

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) container-based development platform will be enabled on your project by default.

Workspace contains:

- **rust**: for builds
- [wasmd](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd): for local node setup and client
- **jq**: shell JSON manipulation tool

Follow [Gitpod Getting Started](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started) and launch your workspace.
